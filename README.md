# LisbonTalk
Talk held at 5th Portuguese Congress of Demography, 6-Oct-2016

This includes the presentation (mostly just images and screenshots), as well as five hermetic excercises, of which we only got through the first four. The exercises all call R/Functions.R, which is a chaotic and entirely undocumented script at this time. I'll probably extract the goodies from there at a trickle pace and include them in blog posts, or similar.
